# Mutual Fund Analysis 📊💼

This is a **Python-based project** in **Jupyter Notebook** that evaluates **mutual fund performance**, **risk**, and **return**. It leverages data from sources like **Yahoo Finance** and **Quandl** to help investors make more informed decisions by providing in-depth risk assessment, performance comparison, and interactive visualizations.

## Prerequisites 📋

Before running this project locally, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab 📓
- Libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `yfinance` installed 📦

## Installation ⚙️

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sujalbafna/Mutual-Fund-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Mutual-Fund-Analysis
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the notebook and run the cells to analyze mutual fund performance!

## Features 🚀

- **Risk Assessment** ⚖️: Evaluate the risk of different mutual funds by analyzing their volatility, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio.
- **Performance Comparison** 📈: Compare the returns of different mutual funds over specified time periods.
- **Interactive Visualizations** 📊: Visualize fund performance using line charts, bar graphs, and other interactive plots.
- **Data Integration** 🌍: Pull real-time financial data from **Yahoo Finance** and **Quandl** to ensure up-to-date analysis.
- **Informed Decision-Making** 💡: Make investment decisions based on data-driven insights about risk and return.

## Example Usage 💡

1. Once you’ve set up the notebook locally, open the `Mutual_Fund_Analysis.ipynb` file.
2. Run the cells to load mutual fund data and calculate key performance metrics.
3. Review the visualizations and insights to compare mutual funds based on their performance, risk, and return.
